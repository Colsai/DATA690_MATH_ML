For each individual, find the total number of employees that report to them. (including direct report and all the indirect reports)
Example, there is 1 employee directly reporting to 1 (#11), but indirectly, #12,#13 and #14 all report to 1. Therefore, #1 should have 1+3 = 4 reports.
Do this for all employees, and if one doesnâ€™t have a direct report, the count is 0.
Do this in SQL and Pandas.
