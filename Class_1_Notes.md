# Class 1 Notes

## Teaching Philosophy: Practicality-driven
- Understand your goals and backgrounds
- Status of the tech job market (DA, DS, MLE, SWE, PM)
- Start Slow (in 4-5 weeks, pick up pace)

## Code of conduct:
- Your first assignment: By Friday, send me an email on:
- Why you want to study data science and machine learning?
- Tell me your math, ML and coding background
- Set your goal by graduation

## Different levels of proficiency:
Beginner: You have some background knowledeg in algebra/geometry/probability/calculus, but have little math training.  
Moderate: You have a background in math/stats, and know how ML algorithms work in general. You may have some working knowledge on how data and ML algorithms marry.  
Advanced: You can hardcode out basic ML algorithms such as KNN, K-means, GMM, PCA, Logisitic Regression. You generally know what models to use and what hyperparameters to tune on.  
Mastered it Well: You can hardcode ML algorithms such as decision trees, RF, DNN. You know exactly what potential problems are when an algorithm isn't working.  
Kudos to you: You can hardcode advanced ML algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, gradient boosting. You are at the frontier of ML dev stack.
