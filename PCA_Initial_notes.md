#PCA Week 8 Notes
1. Eigenvalue and Eigenvectors are unique properties of square matrices.
2. The most important square ematrix in DS is the Covariance matrix. Given features X, how to compute the covariance matrix? 
Say you have 100 features and 10000 data points, what does the covariance measure?
